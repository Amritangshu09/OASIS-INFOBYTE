**BMI Calculator**

This Python script implements a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator using the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). Users can input their weight in kilograms and height in meters, and the script calculates their BMI and BMI category based on the entered values.

### Features:
1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Utilizes Tkinter, a standard GUI toolkit for Python, to create an interactive interface for the BMI calculator.
2. **Input Validation:** Validates user input to ensure that valid numeric values are entered for weight and height.
3. **BMI Calculation:** Calculates the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2.
4. **BMI Categorization:** Categorizes the calculated BMI into one of the following categories: Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese.
5. **Error Handling:** Displays error messages using Tkinter's `messagebox` module if invalid input is provided.

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

### Usage:
1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python bmicalculator.py
   ```
3. Enter your weight in kilograms and height in meters into the respective input fields.
4. Click the "Calculate BMI" button to calculate your BMI.
5. The calculated BMI and BMI category will be displayed below the input fields.

### Note:
- This BMI calculator provides a basic estimation of BMI and should not be considered a definitive measure of health.
- Consult a healthcare professional for accurate assessment and interpretation of BMI results.
