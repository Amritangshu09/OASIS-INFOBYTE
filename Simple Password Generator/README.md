**Password Generator**

This Python script implements a simple password generator using the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). Users can specify the length of the password and choose its strength level (Low, Medium, or Strong), and the script will generate a random password accordingly.

### Features:
1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Utilizes Tkinter, a standard GUI toolkit for Python, to create an interactive interface for the password generator.
2. **Password Length:** Allows users to specify the length of the password they want to generate.
3. **Password Strength Levels:** Offers three strength levels for generated passwords: Low (only letters), Medium (letters and digits), and Strong (letters, digits, and special characters).
4. **Password Generation:** Generates random passwords based on the specified length and strength level.
5. **Error Handling:** Displays an error message if the specified password length is less than 4 characters.

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

### Usage:
1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python password_generator.py
   ```
3. Enter the desired password length into the input field.
4. Select the desired strength level using the radio buttons (Low, Medium, or Strong).
5. Click the "Generate Password" button to generate a random password.
6. The generated password will be displayed below the input fields.

### Note:
- This password generator provides a basic mechanism for generating random passwords and should not be considered for secure purposes without further enhancements.
- For more secure password generation, consider using specialized libraries or services that offer advanced encryption and hashing techniques.
